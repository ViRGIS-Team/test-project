# GDAL, MDAL, PDAL Unity Test Project

This is a small project that is used to test build the following, related UPM packages:

- GDAL [![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.virgis.gdal?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.virgis.gdal/) [GitHub](https://github.com/ViRGIS-Team/gdal-upm)
- PDAL [![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.virgis.pdal?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.virgis.pdal/) [GitHub](https://github.com/ViRGIS-Team/pdal-upm)
- MDAL [![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.virgis.mdal?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.virgis.mdal/) [GitHub](https://github.com/ViRGIS-Team/mdal-upm)

The project tests that the package loads the plugin correctly and the plugin can be called successfully. If you can see coloured artifacts on the screen, then the application is working but you really need to check the Player Log to know that it all worked.
